What is a Conditional Type in TypeScript?

A conditional type in TypeScript allows you to create types based on a condition. It follows this syntax:
T extends U ? X : Y

This means:
If type T can be assigned to type U, then the type will be X, otherwise it will be Y.
It is useful for writing dynamic, type-safe logic in TypeScript.
